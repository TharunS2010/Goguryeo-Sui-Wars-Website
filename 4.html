  <p>There were two major battles that we know of today, The battle of <b>  Salsu </b> and The battle of <b>Linyuguan</b></p>
  <h2>The battle of Linyuguan (598) </h2> 
  <p>with tensions increasing because of the alliance with the turks, and Yeongyang explctly going against china,</p>
<p>Gang Yi-sik(The name given to the Goguryeo commander) sudjested that they attack now as it was likely china would attack them soon.</p>
<p> Yeongyang agrees, and they Attack the path at Linyuguan. But not long after Wei Chong ( Governor of Yingzhou) drove them off in deafeat.</p>
<P> Emporer Yang Di, then supplied 300,000 total troops. That big of a number caused all attack on Linyuguan by Goguryeo failied, and the Battle of linyuguan had ended.</P>
<p></p>

<h2>The battle of Salsu (612) </h2> 
<p>The battle of Salsu, otherwise known as the great assult took place in 612 when the last emporer of the Sui,</p>
<p>Emporer Yang Di, dispatched 1,138,000 soldeirs to tear down Goguryeo</p>
<p> around 300,000 of those troops were dispatched and heading for the capital of Goguryeo. </p>
<p>as the istanse was long, the Sui had the problem of supplies. So each man had to cary everything they would use.</p>
<p> May people ended up leaving it as there was no better option and ships weren't plausable due too naval attacks.</p>
<p>on top of this major flaw, the way intructions were gving were va carier pigeon, the genrals couldn't make desisions but they had to ask the emporer what to do.</p>
<p> but as he wasn't there, is a message reuestg fir perrmission to surrender was sent,by the time it got back, they were already dead & captured.</p>
<p> the only thing saving them was the fact that Goguryeo didn't know.</p>
<p> and that too changed when genral <b>Euliji Mundeok</b> faked "negotiating for peace"</p>
<p> to asses Sui's positon. After he was done, he reporteded the information. after some strategic planning, the ideas were set into motion.</p>
<p>of the 300,00 troops that went to the capital, a little under 2,000 survived.</p>
<p> for Goguyeo, they were weakend, alowing the tang to conuer them later, but as of now?</p>
<p> This was an absolute win. China on the other hand....... had its leader strangled.</p>
